## Security principles

The Principles of Security can be classified as follows:- 

1. **Confidentiality** :- The Principles specifies that only the sender and receiver will be able to access the informaction shared between them. Confidentiality compromises if an unauthorized person is able to access the message. For Example, let us consider sender A wants to share some confidential information with reveiver B and the information intercepted by the attacker C. Now the information is in the hands of an intruder C. 

2. **Authentication** :- Authentication is the mechanism to identify the user or system or the entity. It ensures the identity of the person who is trying to access the information. The authorized person whose identity is preregistered can prove his/her identity and can access the sensitive information. 

3. **Access Control** :- The Principle of access control is determined by role management and rule management. Role management determines who should access the data while rule management determines up to what extent one can access the data. The information displayed is dependent on the person who is accessing it. 

4. **Availability** :- The principle of availability states that the resources will be available to authorize party at all times. Information will not be useful if it is not available to be accessed. System should have sufficient availability of information to satisfy the user request. 

5. **Integrity** :- Integity gives the accurance that the information received exact and accrucate. If the contanat of message is changed after the sender sends is but before reaching the intended receiver, than it is said that the integrity of the message is lost.

## Threats and attack techniques

## Introduction to security 
  Cyber Security is the practice of definding computers, servrs, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks and data from malicious attcks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. 
  
#### The few common categories.  
  
1. **Network Security** 
              We can say that it secure the computer network from targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
 
2. **Application Security** 
              This focueses on keeping software and devices free of threats. Successful security being is the designe stage, well before a program or device is deployed. 
  
3. **Operational Security**
