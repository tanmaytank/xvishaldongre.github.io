<p>The history of the computer dates back to several years. There are four prominent generations of computers. Each generation has witnessed several technological advances which change the functionality of the computers. This results in more compact, powerful, robust systems which are less expensive. The computer as we know it today had its beginning with a 19th century English mathematics professor name Charles Babbage. He designed the Analytical Engine and it was this design that the basic framework of the computers of today are based on.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture</strong> - &ldquo;The complex or carefully designed structure of something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The basic concept behing the von Neuman architecture is the ability to store program instruction in memory along with the data on which those instructions operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Von Neumann architecture describes a general framework, or structure, that a computer&rsquo;s hardware, programming and data should follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even all the most mordern computers and mobile devices are designed based on this fundamental concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has 3 basic components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I/O Interface</strong></li>
<li><strong>CPU</strong></li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buses (denoted by the arrows) carries the data around</p>

<h3 id="memory">Memory<a href="#memory" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>A memory is like brain that store data and information Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. the memory is devided into large number of small part called cells , each cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one.</p>
<p>Memory is primarily of three types −</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache Memory</li>
<li>Primary Memory/Main Memory</li>
<li>Secondary Memory</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-memory">Cache memory<a href="#cache-memory" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong> - The advantages of cache memory are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache memory is faster than main memory.</li>
<li>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</li>
<li>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.</li>
<li>It stores data for temporary use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong> - The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache memory has limited capacity.</li>
<li>It is very expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="primary-memory">Primary memory<a href="#primary-memory" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<p>Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. It devide into two subcategories RAM AND ROM.</p>
<h5 id="ram-random-access-memory">RAM (RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY)<a href="#ram-random-access-memory" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h5>
<p>RAM is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.</p>
<p><strong>Types of RAM are as follow:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. SRAM (Static Random Acess Memory)</strong></p>
<p>The word static indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied,butas power gets down the data is get lost due to his volatile nature.
SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors.</p>
<p>Characteristic of Static RAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long life</li>
<li>No need to refresh</li>
<li>Faster</li>
<li>Used as cache memory</li>
<li>Large size</li>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>High power consumption</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)</strong></p>
<p>DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually refreshed in order to maintain the data. This is done byplacing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Dynamic RAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short data lifetime</li>
<li>Needs to be refreshed continuously</li>
<li>Slower as compared to SRAM</li>
<li>Used as RAM</li>
<li>Smaller in size</li>
<li>Less expensive</li>
<li>Less power consumption</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="rom-read-only-memory">ROM (Read Only Memory)<a href="#rom-read-only-memory" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h5>
<p>The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile, in ROM the memory is stored permanetly in such memories during their manufacture, A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer.</p>
<p><strong>Types of RAM are as follow:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. PROM (Programble And Read Only Memory)</strong></p>
<p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p>
<p><strong>2. EPROM (Erasable And Programmable Read Only Memory)</strong></p>
<p>EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region.</p>
<p><strong>3. Flash Memory or EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)</strong></p>
<p>Flash memory is a non-volatile memory chip used for storage and for transfering data between a personal computer (PC) and digital devices. It has the ability to be electronically reprogrammed and erased.</p>
<h4 id="seconday-memeory">Seconday Memeory<a href="#seconday-memeory" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<p>Secondary memory refers to storage devices, such as hard drives and solid state drives. It may also refer to removable storage media, such as USB flash drives, CDs, and DVDs. &hellip; Additionally, secondary memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains its data with or without electrical power.</p>
<p>Hard drives, solid state drives, USB Flash drives, CDs, and DVDs are know as Secondary memory. Secondary memory is non-volatile, non-volatile means it retains its data with or without electrical power.</p>
<h4 id="other-types-of-memory">Other types of memory<a href="#other-types-of-memory" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Auxiliary memory</strong> - Auxiliary memory is much larger in size than main memory but is slower. It normally stores system programs, instruction and data files. It is also known as secondary memory. It can also be used as an overflow/virtual memory in case the main memory capacity has been exceeded,Secondary memories cannot be accessed directly by a processor. First the data/information of auxiliary memory is transferred to the main memory and then that information can be accessed by the CPU.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Non-volatile memory − Data is not lost when power is cut off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reusable − The data stays in the secondary storage on permanent basis until it is not overwritten or deleted by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable − Data in secondary storage is safe because of high physical stability of secondary storage device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convenience − With the help of a computer software, authorised people can locate and access the data quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacity − Secondary storage can store large volumes of data in sets of multiple disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost − It is much lesser expensive to store data on a tape or disk than primary memory.</p>

<p>Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects the programs and data together in a batch before processing starts. thier are some following activities related to batch processing
The OS defines a job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit.
The OS keeps a number a jobs in memory and executA single-user operating system is a type of system that has been developed and designed to use on a computer.
It can be used on a similar device, and it only has one user at a time.</p>
<h4 id="single-user">Single User<a href="#single-user" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<p>A single-user operating system is a type of system that has been developed and designed to use on a computer. It can be used on a similar device, and it only has one user at a time. It&rsquo;s the most common system used for home computers.</p>
<h4 id="multi-user">Multi User<a href="#multi-user" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<p>It is an operating system that permits several users to utilize the programs that are concurrently running on a single network server. The single network server is termed as &ldquo;Terminal server&rdquo;. &ldquo;Terminal client&rdquo; is a software that supports user sessions.</p>
<h4 id="multiprogramming">Multiprogramming<a href="#multiprogramming" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<p>Multiprogramming is an extension to the batch processing where the CPU is kept always busy. Each process needs two types of system time: CPU time and IO time.</p>
<p>In multiprogramming environment, for the time a process does its I/O, The CPU can start the execution of other processes. Therefore, multiprogramming improves the efficiency of the system.</p>
<h4 id="multi-tasking">Multi-Tasking<a href="#multi-tasking" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h4>
<p>Multitasking is when multiple jobs are executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between them. Switches occur so frequently that the users may interact with each program while it is running.
The user gives instructions to the operating system or to a program directly, and receives an immediate response.
The OS handles multitasking in the way that it can handle multiple operations/executes multiple programs at a time.</p>

<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming languages<a href="#programming-languages" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.</p>
<p>The programming langugage is classified into two classes
<strong>1. Low-level</strong>
<strong>2. High-level</strong></p>
<h3 id="low-level-language">Low level language<a href="#low-level-language" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Low-level programming languages are closer to machine code, or binary. Therefore, they’re more difficult for humans to read (although they’re still easier to understand than 1s and 0s). but the low level language is faster and precise control over how the computer will work.</p>
<h3 id="high-level-language">High level language<a href="#high-level-language" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>High-level programming languages are closer to how humans communicate. High-level languages use words that are closer to the words we use in our everyday lives.This means they’re easier to program in than low-level programming languages, although they do take more time to translate into machine code for the computer.</p>
<h3 id="machine-language">Machine language<a href="#machine-language" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Machine language is the language understood by a computer. &hellip; All programs and programming languages eventually generate or run programs in machine language. Machine language is made up of instructions and data that are all binary numbers.</p>
<h3 id="assembly">Assembly<a href="#assembly" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>Assembly language is a low-level language that needs compiler and interpreter, which converts that language to machine language.</p>

<h2 id="disk-operating-system-dos">Disk Operating System (DOS)<a href="#disk-operating-system-dos" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h2>
<p>MS-DOS is one of the oldest and widely used operating system. DOS is a set of computer programs, the major functions of which are file management, allocation of system resources, providing essential features to control hardware devices.</p>
<p>DOS commands can be typed in either upper case or lower case.</p>
<h3 id="history--versions-of-dos">History &amp; Versions of DOS<a href="#history--versions-of-dos" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> </h3>
<p>DOS was the first operating system used by IBM-compatible computers. It was originally available in two versions that were essentially the same, but marketed under two different names. &ldquo;PC-DOS&rdquo; was the version developed by IBM and sold to the first IBM-compatible manufacturers. &ldquo;MS-DOS&rdquo; was the version that Microsoft bought the rights to, and was bundled with the first versions of Windows.
The first versions of Windows (through Windows 95) actually ran on top of the DOS operating system. This is why so many DOS-related files (such as .INI, .DLL, and .COM files) are still used by Windows.
DOS is still included with Windows, but is run from the Windows operating system instead of the other way around. The DOS command prompt can be opened in Windows by selecting &ldquo;Run&hellip;&rdquo; from the Start Menu and typing cmd.</p>
